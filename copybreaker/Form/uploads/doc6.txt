For all the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't

And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
You gotta go and get angry
at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do 
too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time
could someone call a referee
Cause I just need one more shot 
at forgiveness
I know you know that I made 
those mistakes
maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean
maybe a couple of hundred times
So let me oh let me redeem
oh redeem oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot 
at second chances
Yeah is it too late
now to say sorry
Cause I'm missing
more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry
Yeah I know all that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now
I'm sorry yeah
Sorry yeah
Sorry
Yeah I know all that I let you down
Is it too late to say sorry now
I'll take every single piece of 
the blame if you want me to
